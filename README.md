  (WITH AID: used Leaflet's online tutorial "Interactive Choropleth Map" as reference:
  https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)

This a map that visualizes the json data from the United States Geological Survey of USGS. This map covers data of earthquakes globally:

 - This map (a screenshot of the map below) shows each earthquake event mapped by its coordinates along with additional information (coordinates, location/address, magnitude, depth) when the user clicks on the event marker. 

 - The size of the radius of each event reflects with the magnitude of the earthquakes.

 - The color indicated the depth of the earthquake.
